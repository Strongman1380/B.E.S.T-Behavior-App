# Complete Firebase Setup Instructions

## Current Status
The application is currently running in **demo mode** with localStorage for fast performance. To enable full Firebase functionality, follow these steps:

## Firebase Project Details (Provided)
- **Project Name**: best education monitor app
- **Project ID**: best-education-monitor-app  
- **Project Number**: 477438965464
- **Web API Key**: [REDACTED - Get from Firebase Console]

## Missing Information Needed
To complete the Firebase setup, you need to get the **complete App ID** from your Firebase Console.

## Steps to Get Complete Firebase Configuration

### 1. Access Firebase Console
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: "best education monitor app"

### 2. Get the Complete App ID
1. Go to **Project Settings** (gear icon)
2. Scroll down to "Your apps" section
3. Find your web app configuration
4. Copy the complete `appId` value (it should look like: `1:477438965464:web:xxxxxxxxxx`)

### 3. Update Environment Variables
Once you have the complete App ID, update the `.env` file:

```env
# Firebase Configuration - Complete setup
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_FROM_FIREBASE_CONSOLE
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=best-education-monitor-app.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=best-education-monitor-app
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=best-education-monitor-app.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=477438965464
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:477438965464:web:YOUR_COMPLETE_APP_ID_HERE
```

### 4. Enable Authentication Methods
In Firebase Console, go to **Authentication** > **Sign-in method** and enable:
- Email/Password
- Google (optional)
- Phone (optional)

### 5. Set Up Firestore Database
1. Go to **Firestore Database**
2. Create database in production mode
3. Set up security rules for authenticated users

### 6. Configure Authorized Domains
In **Authentication** > **Settings** > **Authorized domains**, add:
- `localhost` (for development)
- Your production domain

## Performance Note
The application was switched back to demo mode because incomplete Firebase credentials were causing:
- Repeated 400 HTTP errors
- Slow loading times
- Firebase connection timeouts

Once you provide the complete App ID, the application will seamlessly switch to Firebase with full cloud functionality.
