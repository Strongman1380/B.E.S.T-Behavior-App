# Behavior Summary Changes

## Overview
Updated the Behavior Summary Reports to remove checkboxes and notes sections, replacing them with a cleaner text-based format focused on narrative descriptions.

## Changes Made

### ✅ **SummaryForm Component** (`src/components/behavior-summary/SummaryForm.jsx`)

**Removed:**
- All checkbox-based behavior categories (Participation, Attitude Toward Staff, Peer Interactions, Focus and Attention)
- Individual notes fields for each category
- BehaviorCheckbox component dependency

**Added:**
- **Strengths** - Text area for describing student's behavioral strengths and positive qualities
- **Improvements Needed** - Text area for identifying areas needing behavioral improvement

**Kept:**
- Date range selection (start/end dates)
- Prepared by field
- General Behavior Overview
- Behavioral Incidents
- Summary & Recommendations

### ✅ **Print Dialog** (`src/components/behavior/PrintBehaviorSummariesDialog.jsx`)

**Updated:**
- Removed all checkbox rendering logic
- Updated completion criteria to check for `strengths` and `improvements_needed` instead of checkbox fields
- Simplified print layout to show clean text sections
- Updated CSS styles to remove checkbox-specific formatting

### ✅ **Sample Data** (`src/api/localStorage.js`)

**Added:**
- Sample behavior summaries for Emma Johnson and Marcus Williams
- Realistic examples showing both positive and challenging behaviors
- Proper date ranges and detailed narrative descriptions

## New Behavior Summary Structure

```javascript
{
  date_range_start: "2024-01-01",
  date_range_end: "2024-01-07", 
  prepared_by: "Teacher Name",
  general_behavior_overview: "Overall behavior description...",
  strengths: "Student's behavioral strengths...",
  improvements_needed: "Areas needing improvement...",
  behavioral_incidents: "Specific incidents if any...",
  summary_recommendations: "Summary and recommendations..."
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Interface** - No more cluttered checkboxes
2. **More Descriptive** - Narrative format provides richer information
3. **Flexible** - Teachers can write detailed, personalized descriptions
4. **Professional** - Better suited for parent conferences and documentation
5. **Easier to Read** - Print format is cleaner and more professional
